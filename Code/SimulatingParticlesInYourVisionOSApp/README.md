# Simulating particles in your visionOS app

Add a particle emitter to an entity in your app's RealityKit scene by adding a
particle emitter component to it.
You can create a wide variety of effects by configuring the emitter and the
particles it creates.   

For more information about the app and how it works, see
[Simulating particles in your visionOS app][link-to-sample]
in the developer documentation.
