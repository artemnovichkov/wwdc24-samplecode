        /// It's useful for scenarios where movement should be restricted to discrete positions,
        /// like on a grid or along a path.
        ///

        /// ```swift
        /// let constraint = MoveConstraint.points([

        /// and returns a `SIMD3<Float>` that represents the allowed position.
