# Creating a spatial drawing app with RealityKit

Use low-level mesh and texture APIs to achieve fast updates to a person's brush
strokes by integrating RealityKit with ARKit and SwiftUI.

## Overview

- Note: This sample code project is associated with WWDC24 session 10104: 
[Build a spatial drawing app with RealityKit](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc24/10104/).

## Configure the sample code project

To run this sample code, you'll need:

* An Apple Vision Pro with visionOS 2 or later
* Xcode 16 or later

Because this sample app uses ARKit hand tracking on visionOS, drawing features 
aren't available in the visionOS simulator.
