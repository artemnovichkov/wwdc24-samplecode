# Creating a data visualization dashboard with Swift Charts

Visualize an entire data collection efficiently by instantiating a single vectorized plot in Swift Charts.

## Overview

- Note: This sample code project is associated with WWDC24 session 10155: [Swift Charts: Vectorized and function plots](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc24/10155/).

This sample shows how to visualize a dataset using a variety of chart types including histograms, scatterplots, heatmaps, and more.
The sample takes advantage of vectorized plots to enable efficient plotting data of an entire ``RandomAccessCollection``, and function graphing to visualize meaningful trends in that data.
The app is a dashboard that visualizes large-scale solar photovoltaic facilities in the contiguous United States by consuming data from the U.S. Geological Survey and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
