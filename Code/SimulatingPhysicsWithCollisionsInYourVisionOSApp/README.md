# Simulating physics with collisions in your visionOS app

Add simulation physics to items in your app's RealityKit scene by defining each
item's physical shape and how it responds to forces and interactions.  

For more information about the app and how it works, see
[Simulating physics with collisions in your visionOS app][link-to-sample].
