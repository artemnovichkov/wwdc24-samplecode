# Rendering a windowed game in stereo

Bring an iOS or iPadOS game to visionOS and enhance it.

## Overview

This sample shows how to render a Metal app in a window on visionOS, with
stereoscopy, head tracking, [VRR](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/render_passes/rendering_at_different_rasterization_rates),
and a 3D frame around the window.
The starting app is the [Deferred Lighting sample](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/metal_sample_code_library/rendering_a_scene_with_deferred_lighting_in_swift) for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.
